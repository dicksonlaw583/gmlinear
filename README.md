# GMLinear Legacy v1.0.0 (Archived Release)

## Deprecation Notice: This is an archived release!

This repository is now only available for archival purposes. Please see the following for supported releases:

- For GameMaker Studio 2.x: [gmlinear2](https://github.com/dicksonlaw583/gmlinear2/releases)

## Introduction
GMLinear is an implementation of matrix and vector operations in pure GML. You can use it to simplify many common calculations in 2D and 3D geometry and implement algorithms/formulas involving linear algebra. Hard-coded optimized functions are available for 2D, 3D and 4D vectors and 2x2, 3x3 and 4x4 matrices.

## Requirements

- GameMaker Studio 1.4.9999

## Installation

Simply drag `gmlinear_core.gml` into your open project. You can optionally import `constants.txt` to index vector components with human-readable names.
